- 👋 Hi, I’m Arti Sukasem (@arti-sukasem), I am a biomedical engineer. I am a software developer at Auckland Bioengineering Institute. 
-  My current Github projects are computational modelling for 3D human models (e.g. lung, brainstem, etc.) for SPARC (https://sparc.science/) and 12Labour (https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/abi/our-research/research-groups-themes/12-Labours.html). For this role, I created algorithms for a 3D airway and lung models, which can be used for simulations and customise these models with a real dataset. This project was written in Python (please checkout my github repo and my 3D models on my personal website)

- 👀 I’m interested in financial investment and software development. 
-     My expertise are Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, React.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Fullstack web development.

- 💞️ I’m looking for a career change into a web development, that I can grow and make a decent work. Please contact me if you are interested in hiring :)
